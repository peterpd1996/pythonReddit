1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,787
In a

2
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:01,968
quiet village where

3
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,149
the sky brushes

4
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:03,937
the fields

5
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,118
in hues of

6
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:05,905
gold, young

7
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:06,692
Mia discovered

8
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:07,874
a map leading

9
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,661
to forgotten

10
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:09,842
treasures. Little did

11
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:10,629
she know,

12
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:11,417
her cat

13
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:12,204
Whiskers had

14
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:12,992
a secret:

15
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,173
he was the

16
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:14,960
guardian of

17
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,748
the map,

18
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:16,535
tasked with

19
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,716
guiding Mia to

20
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:18,897
not only the

21
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,078
treasure but also

22
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:21,259
to her destiny.
